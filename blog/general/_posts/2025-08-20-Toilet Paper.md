I moved into a new apartment recently, one that is extremely old and in desperate need of some modernization. It's also missing a few things, like a toilet paper roller. Luckily, I'm a nerd with a 3d printer, and I spit one out in a couple of hours. It works pretty well! Unfortunately, the springs I had on hand didn't work with my design, but I'm sure someone out there can get it to work.
