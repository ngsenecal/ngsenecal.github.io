            My name is Neil Senecal, a Mechanical Engineering Student at Brigham Young University.<br> 
            My strengths lie in my problem solving abilities and my refusal to give up. As a result, I have experience in all facets of engineering: electrical, physical, and software.<br><br>
            I am familiar with Python and C++ for embedded systems and have experience with 3D modeling and additive manufacturing. My tool of choice is FreeCAD, but I have experience with Autodesk products.<br><br>
            In my free time I am always looking for something new to fiddle with, which is how most of my projects ended up happening, like this website!
