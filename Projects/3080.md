A few months ago, I was shuffling around some drives between various devices that I have on hand and found that the 30mm nvme drive I wanted to stick into a laptop wouldn't fit because there was no mounting hole for it. There was, however, a hole for a 80mm ssd.

I came up with an adapter that latches the 30mm drive in place and prevents it from moving around. The ssd itself slots into two rails on the adaper, and the entire assembly can be installed as a normal 80mm ssd would.

Downloads for the adapter can be found [here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7135323)
