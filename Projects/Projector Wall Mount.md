I picked up a cheap projector off of ebay for use in my apartment. It works decently well for $20 and has a standard thread for use on a camera tripod, which we have been doing. Unfortunately, it blocks off the center of the couch so no one can comfortably sit there.

My roomates asked if I could find a wall mount solution, and so I took that as a challenge. This design took me a single day to design and print. I wasn't certain on the exact measurements of my projector (it's a cheap chinese one that comes in many versions and styles) so I printed two mirrored shelves that each used a 20lb command strip to adhere to the wall. I was able to then space them on the wall by resting the projector on each shelf's "arm."
Of course, when something protrudes from the wall that much, it tends to splay apart. I had to add a front brace to prevent the arms from springing open. After that, it was just a matter of finding the correct angle and printing a spacer that slots into each shelf arm.
