Despite the title, I have no association whatsoever with DARPA. This project came about when I was tasked with creating a design that utilized 4-bar linkages for one of my engineering courses. For some reason, [this video](https://youtu.be/HrQrJ57J9eE) came to mind, specifically the transforming wheel. You can see that the wheels change from a generally circular shapes into triangular tractor treads.

While certainly not exact, my design is a rough reconstruction of what the general mechanism for such a wheel could be and I hope to pursue creating a working prototype in the future.
