I am a bit of a data hoarder and a hardware pack rat. As a result, there are quite a few 2.5" drives floating around without homes. I looked into a few 3d-printable caddies, but none really piqued my interest.

I really like modularity, so my design is stackable and utilizes the wide array of m3 screws that one (hopefully) already has on hand in order to connect the levels together. Due to the size of the feet and general instability of a stack, I wouldn't stack more than 5-6 drives unless the base was secured.
