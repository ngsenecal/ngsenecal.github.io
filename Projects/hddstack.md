I am a bit of a data hoarder and a hardware pack rat. The result is having quite a few 2.5" drives laying around with no good place to put them. I looked into a few 3d-printable caddies, but none really piqued my interest.

My design is stackable and utilizes the wide array of m3 screws that one (hopefully) has on hand. Due to the size of the feet and general instability of a stack, I wouldn't stack more than 5-6 drives unless the base was secured.
