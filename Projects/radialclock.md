For whatever reason, I noticed that the majority of a clock face is largely wasted. Because a clock's hands originate in the center and point outward, most of the space that the hands cover is unusable. An alternative that I developed is the radial clock.
Instead of hands that originate in the center of the clock, time is instead indicated by using two co-centric disks. The outer disk displays information relating to minutes and the inner disk indicates the hour, much like a normal clock. To read the time, you can estimate based on the orientation of the arrows, or simply read the numbers that are at the top of each disk.

This particular design is digital and is powered by a raspberry pi. To show how the central area can be used, I mounted a digital display that shows the time in roman numerals. Scaled down, I think this would make a very interesting smart watch design.
