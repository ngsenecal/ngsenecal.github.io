One of several modifications that I've done to keep my pc case from the early 2000s relevant was the addition of a top exhaust fan mount.
My case comes from the Lenovo Ideacentre K300, which just so happens to have a handle at the top which, when removed, has just enough space for a 120mm fan. After doing some digging, I found [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3048439) by IDoesStuff on thingiverse, which is excellent. It fills the hole left from the handle and uses the fan itself to clamp the entire assembly in place. 
I did, however, need a design that could account for a low-profile 120mm fan, which has a tighter spacing for the mounting holes. After about an hour of design, this was the final product. It works well and when paired with a 120 mm grille, it fits snug in the case.

Downloads for the mount can be found [here](/404).
