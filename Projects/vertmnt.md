One of the many things that I allocate time on my desktop computer for is node computing. I participate in [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) and [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/), two distributed computing programs that utilize ordinary hardware to solve problems that supercomputers would ordinarily have to complete.

While my computer certainly has the specs to crunch the numbers given to it, the case that its hardware is housed in is somewhat lackluster.
Or at least, that's what I thought.

The K300 has two massive vents on its side panels that just so happen to line up with an unused hdd caddy. After grinding out the rivets holding it in place, it turned out to be barely enough space to mount a twin fan GPU. Cables would have to be plugged in to right angle adapters, but that was a sacrifice I was willing to make.

A major improvement I'd like to make is the ability to slide the ssd outward in order to better access the ports inides, although this will remain a lesser priortity until port access actually becomes a problem.
