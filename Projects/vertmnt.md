When I'm not busy, I allocate time on my desktop computer for node computtation. I participate in [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) and [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/), two distributed computing programs that utilize ordinary hardware to solve problems that ordinarily require supercomputers. This can take quite a bit of power and heat.
My desktop is a Lenovo Ideacentre K300, a workstation from the early 2000s. It's not meant to house and cool an RTX 3060. It does, however have two massive vents on it's side panels that line up to an unused HDD caddy. After grinding out the rivets holding it in place, the empty space turned out to be barely large enough to mount my GPU. Cables require right angle adapters, but that was a sacrifice I was willing to make.

The mount itself is held together with M3 screws/nuts and supports both the pcie mount and the rear of the GPU. I have no problems with transporting or moving my PC for cleaning.
A major improvement I'd like to make is the ability to slide the GPU outward on a rail in order to better access the ports, although this will remain a lesser priortity until port access actually becomes a problem.

Downloads for the mount's components can be found [here.](/404)
